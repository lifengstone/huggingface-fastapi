# ðŸ¤— Hugging Face packaging using FastAPI

The web application uses FastAPI with Hugging Face and exposes a single endpoint that you can interact with it. 

To run in Codespace:
- run ```cd webapp```
- run ```uvicorn --host 0.0.0.0 main:app```

After the FastAPI server is up, go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs to play with it!
